Boss1	Who are you? What are you doing here?
Morale	I'm from the village
Morale	I was following an asura into the forest
Boss1	I didn't see anything
Morale	It went right past you...
Boss1	Nobody can enter the forest, it's a sacred place.
Morale	And you are the guard?
Boss1	Yes, an ordinary human, just like you.
Morale	But don't you have a tail?
Boss1	Don't talk about my tail!
