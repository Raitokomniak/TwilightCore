All worlds that rotate around their axis obtain a Guardian
The solar rhythm of this world has been trusted to a young witch called Soma
She picked up a hobby to battle the daily monotony of maintaining the Cores
As an avid pumpkin farmer, she obsesses over the size and quality of her produce
One day she thought... "I wonder if the day lasted for a tiiiiny bit longer, would they grow a little larger?"
That evening she delayed her duties with the cores
When she crawled around in the patch and dropped her hat, the cores of Day and Night stayed intact 
But the Twilight Core was stolen by the swift handsâ€¦ of an Asura!
