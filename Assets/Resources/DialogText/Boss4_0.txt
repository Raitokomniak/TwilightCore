???	Ohoho... The itty-bitty witch actually made it through the Asura tempest...
Soma	Hey, it's you from before! Plan to flash me your wealth again?
???	Welcome to the Lotus Garden, little one
Lakshmi	I am Lakshmi
Saraswati	I am Saraswati
Parvati	I am Parvati
Soma	I am here because I'm chasing a thieving asura. Have you seen one?
Lakshmi	Aren't they all filthy little thieves?
Soma	This one stole my... um, family jewel
Saraswati	Oh, you mean the Twilight Core?
Soma	!!!!
Soma	That's it! Where is it?
Saraswati	Sorry little one, the courier passed through here some time ago. The Core must be in our master's hands already
Parvati	Now what's left is to tie up this loose end... Tie it up reeeal tight
Tridevi	Prepare yourself!
