Boss	Who are you? What are you doing here?
Player	I'm from the village
Player	I was following an asura into the forest
Boss	I didn't see anything
Player	It went right past you...
Boss	Nobody can enter the forest, it's a sacred place.
Player	And you are the guard?
Boss	Yes, an ordinary human, just like you.
Player	But don't you have a tail?
Boss	Don't talk about my tail!
